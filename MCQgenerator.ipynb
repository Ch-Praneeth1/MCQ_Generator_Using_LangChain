        "Machine learning models fall into three primary categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "Supervised machine learning\n",
        "Supervised learning, also known as supervised machine learning, is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms to classify data or predict outcomes accurately. As input data is fed into the model, the model adjusts its weights until it has been fitted appropriately. This occurs as part of the cross validation process to ensure that the model avoids overfitting or underfitting. Supervised learning helps organizations solve a variety of real-world problems at scale, such as classifying spam in a separate folder from your inbox. Some methods used in supervised learning include neural networks, naïve bayes, linear regression, logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM).\n",
        "\n",
        "Unsupervised machine learning\n",
        "Unsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets (subsets called clusters). These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention. This method’s ability to discover similarities and differences in information make it ideal for exploratory data analysis, cross-selling strategies, customer segmentation, and image and pattern recognition. It’s also used to reduce the number of features in a model through the process of dimensionality reduction. Principal component analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD) are two common approaches for this. Other algorithms used in unsupervised learning include neural networks, k-means clustering, and probabilistic clustering methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Semi-supervised learning\n",
        "Semi-supervised learning offers a happy medium between supervised and unsupervised learning. During training, it uses a smaller labeled data set to guide classification and feature extraction from a larger, unlabeled data set. Semi-supervised learning can solve the problem of not having enough labeled data for a supervised learning algorithm. It also helps if it’s too costly to label enough data.\n",
        "\n",
        "For a deep dive into the differences between these approaches, check out \"Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning: What's the Difference?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Reinforcement machine learning\n",
        "Reinforcement machine learning is a machine learning model that is similar to supervised learning, but the algorithm isn’t trained using sample data. This model learns as it goes by using trial and error. A sequence of successful outcomes will be reinforced to develop the best recommendation or policy for a given problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "The IBM Watson® system that won the Jeopardy! challenge in 2011 is a good example. The system used reinforcement learning to learn when to attempt an answer (or question, as it were), which square to select on the board, and how much to wager—especially on daily doubles.\n",
        "\n",
        "Learn more about reinforcement learning\n",
        "\n",
        "Common machine learning algorithms\n",
        "A number of machine learning algorithms are commonly used. These include:\n",
        "\n",
        "Neural networks: Neural networks  simulate the way the human brain works, with a huge number of linked processing nodes. Neural networks are good at recognizing patterns and play an important role in applications including natural language translation, image recognition, speech recognition, and image creation.\n",
        "Linear regression: This algorithm is used to predict numerical values, based on a linear relationship between different values. For example, the technique could be used to predict house prices based on historical data for the area.\n",
        "Logistic regression: This supervised learning algorithm makes predictions for categorical response variables, such as “yes/no” answers to questions. It can be used for applications such as classifying spam and quality control on a production line.\n",
        "Clustering: Using unsupervised learning, clustering algorithms can identify patterns in data so that it can be grouped. Computers can help data scientists by identifying differences between data items that humans have overlooked.\n",
        "Decision trees: Decision trees can be used for both predicting numerical values (regression) and classifying data into categories. Decision trees use a branching sequence of linked decisions that can be represented with a tree diagram. One of the advantages of decision trees is that they are easy to validate and audit, unlike the black box of the neural network.\n",
        "Random forests: In a random forest, the machine learning algorithm predicts a value or category by combining the results from a number of decision trees.\n",
        "Advantages and disadvantages of machine learning algorithms\n",
        "Depending on your budget, need for speed and precision required, each algorithm type—supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, or reinforcement—has its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, decision tree algorithms are used for both predicting numerical values (regression problems) and classifying data into categories. Decision trees use a branching sequence of linked decisions that may be represented with a tree diagram. A prime advantage of decision trees is that they are easier to validate and audit than a neural network. The bad news is that they can be more unstable than other decision predictors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, there are many advantages to machine learning that businesses can leverage for new efficiencies. These include machine learning identifying patterns and trends in massive volumes of data that humans might not spot at all. And this analysis requires little human intervention: just feed in the dataset of interest and let the machine learning system assemble and refine its own algorithms—which will continually improve with more data input over time. Customers and users can enjoy a more personalized experience as the model learns more with every experience with that person.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the downside, machine learning requires large training datasets that are accurate and unbiased. GIGO is the operative factor: garbage in / garbage out. Gathering sufficient data and having a system robust enough to run it might also be a drain on resources. Machine learning can also be prone to error, depending on the input. With too small a sample, the system could produce a perfectly logical algorithm that is completely wrong or misleading. To avoid wasting budget or displeasing customers, organizations should act on the answers only when there is high confidence in the output.\n",
        "\n",
        "Real-world machine learning use cases\n",
        "Here are just a few examples of machine learning you might encounter every day:\n",
        "\n",
        "Automated stock trading: Designed to optimize stock portfolios, AI-driven high-frequency trading platforms make thousands or even millions of trades per day without human intervention.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fraud detection: Banks and other financial institutions can use machine learning to spot suspicious transactions.

As input data is fed into the model, the model adjusts its weights until it has been fitted appropriately. This occurs as part of the cross validation process to ensure that the model avoids overfitting or underfitting. Supervised learning helps organizations solve a variety of real-world problems at scale, such as classifying spam in a separate folder from your inbox. Some methods used in supervised learning include neural networks, naïve bayes, linear regression, logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM).\\n\\nUnsupervised machine learning\\nUnsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets (subsets called clusters). These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention. This method’s ability to discover similarities and differences in information make it ideal for exploratory data analysis, cross-selling strategies, customer segmentation, and image and pattern recognition. It’s also used to reduce the number of features in a model through the process of dimensionality reduction. Principal component analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD) are two common approaches for this. Other algorithms used in unsupervised learning include neural networks, k-means clustering, and probabilistic clustering methods.\\n\\nSemi-supervised learning\\nSemi-supervised learning offers a happy medium between supervised and unsupervised learning. During training, it uses a smaller labeled data set to guide classification and feature extraction from a larger, unlabeled data set. Semi-supervised learning can solve the problem of not having enough labeled data for a supervised learning algorithm.
